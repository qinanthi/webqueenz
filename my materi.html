                        Please make a simple paragraph using adverb clause with minimum 15 sentences (free of topic)!<br/>

                        <p><a style="color: rgb(189, 0, 0);">(ANSWER)</a><br/></p>  
                        -Adverbs are adverbs or additional words that provide a clearer and more detailed description of verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.<br/>
                        -Clause is a group of words consisting of a subject and a verb. Clause is divided into two forms, namely independent clause and dependent clause.<br/>
                        - Independent clause is a clause that can stand alone and is considered a complete sentence.<br/>
                        -Adverb clause is a clause as an adverb. Adverbs that are in independent clauses are useful for answering questions such as how, when, where and why. Adverb clauses function as modifiers or explanations for verbs in a sentence<br/>
                        -Adverb clauses have some distinguishing characteristics that set them apart from other types of clauses. They always begin with a subordinating conjunction, and they cannot stand alone as a sentence. Instead, they must be attached to an independent clause to form a complete sentence. Adverb clauses are also marked by a shift in verb tense, with the main clause typically appearing in the present tense and the adverb clause in the past tense<br/>
                        -The characteristic of an adjective clause is that it must be combined with a relative pronoun and relative adverb consisting of: that, where, when, who, whom, whose, which. Unlike its name, this adjective clause does not always contain general adjectives.<br/>
                        <br>
                        <p><a style="color:rgb(189, 0, 0) ;">(Here is a paragraph with an adverb clause)</a><br/></p>
                        yesterday I went to the airport, because I was going back to my hometown, because I knew that the price of consumption at the airport was very expensive,<br/>
                        I decided to bring food and drinks from home for my lunch on the way, but when I was at the airport it turned out that my plane had left quite a long time ago and I decided to look around, there were many places to eat and sellers at the airport,<br/>
                        even though I brought lunch from home but I was very interested in one place to eat there and I decided to go in and try the food there, when I entered I was warmly greeted by the waiter there, the service it was very good there and the place and the food were very tasty and comfortable,<br/>
                        after I finished eating I paid and went to the boarding pass because the plane was about to leave, and in the end I didn't eat the lunch I brought because I was very full, and I was very happy because the service of the airport staff and the service at the restaurant is very good gus and make me feel comfortable<br/>

                        An adverb is a word that can modify or describe a verb, adjective, another adverb, or entire sentence. Adverbs can be used to show manner (how something happens), degree (to what extent), place (where), and time (when).<br/>
                        Adverbs are usually formed by adding -ly to the end of an adjective (e.g., “quick” becomes “quickly”), although there are also other adverbs that don’t have this ending. There are also adverbial phrases, series of words that play the grammatical role of adverbs.<br/>
                        A clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb that have a relationship. This relationship is crucial. A clause conveys information about what that subject is or is doing, rather than simply being a random grouping of words. Because a clause expresses an action or a state of being, a clause can often but not always function as an independent sentence.<br/>
                        A sentence can have just one clause or it can have multiple clauses. The only defining characteristic of a clause is that it must contain a related subject and verb. Clauses play a variety of roles in English and because of this, there are numerous ways to structure and combine them<br/>
                        An adverb clause is a group of words that is used to change or qualify the meaning of an adjective, a verb, a clause, another adverb, or any other type of word or phrase with the exception of determiners and adjectives that directly modify nouns.<br/>
                        <br>
                        Adverb clause functions to modify verbs by indicating concepts such as time, place, condition, cause, and purpose. The different between adverb clause and noun clause is that adverb clause does not have to appear right after the verb it describes.<br/>
                        Adverb clause can appear in two forms: after the main clause or before the clause. Below are the examples of adverb clauses in the two forms.<br/>

                        -Structure conjunctions in English are a type of conjunction used to connect two sentences or phrases with the same structure. Examples of structural conjunctions that are commonly used in English include: "not only... but also," "neither... nor," and "either... or."<br/>
                        -These structural conjunctions can be used in spoken and written English, both in formal and informal situations. It is important to remember that the use of structural conjunctions must comply with the correct rules of English grammar and should not be used carelessly<br/>
                        <br>
                        There are several types of structural conjunctions in English, including:<br/>
*Not only... but also<br/>
Example: Not only did she finish her work on time, but also she did an excellent job.<br/>
*Neither... nor<br/>
Example: Neither the teacher nor the students knew the answer to the question.<br/>
*Either... or<br/>
Example: You can either come with me or stay here alone.<br/>
*Both... and<br/>
Example: The food is both delicious and healthy.<br/>
*Whether... or<br/>
Example: Whether you come or not, I will still go to the party.<br/>
*No sooner... than<br/>
Example: No sooner did he arrive than he started working.<br/>
<br>
The main function of structure conjunctions (konjungsi struktur) in English sentences and English grammar is to connect two clauses or phrases that have the same grammatical structure. <br/>
This connection helps to create more complex and meaningful sentences by indicating relationships between ideas.<br/>
<br>
Here are some specific functions of structure conjunctions in English sentences and English grammar:<br/>
To show contrast: Structure conjunctions such as "not only... but also" and "neither... nor" are often used to show contrast between two ideas. For example: "Not only did she finish her work on time, but also she did an excellent job."<br/>
To show choice: Structure conjunctions such as "either... or" are used to show a choice between two options. For example: "You can either come with me or stay here alone."<br/>
To show similarity: Structure conjunctions such as "both... and" are used to show similarity between two ideas. For example: "The food is both delicious and healthy."<br/>
To show uncertainty: Structure conjunctions such as "whether... or" are used to show uncertainty about a future event. For example: "Whether you come or not, I will still go to the party."<br/>
To show immediacy: Structure conjunctions such as "no sooner... than" are used to show immediacy or simultaneity of two actions. For example: "No sooner did he arrive than he started working."<br/>
<br>
In English grammar, structure conjunctions are used to create compound sentences, which are sentences that have two or more independent clauses joined by a conjunction. <br/>
These conjunctions help to create more complex sentences, and can be used in both spoken and written English in formal and informal settings. However, it is important to use structure conjunctions appropriately and correctly in order to avoid confusion and maintain clarity in communication.<br/>
<p><a style="color: rgb(189, 0, 0);">(Explanation)</a><br/></p>
A conjunction is a word that is used to connect words, phrases, and clauses. There are many conjunctions in the English language, but some common ones include and, or, but, because,<br/>
 for, if, and when.
There are three basic types of conjunctions: coordinating, subordinating, and correlative.<br/>

         using Parallel Structure with Paired Conjunctions is that it is an effective tool for ensuring uniformity and harmony in a sentence.<br/>
         The use of parallel structures with paired conjunctions helps to increase the clarity and readability of the text, and avoids ambiguity and confusion for the reader or listener.<br/>
          It can also provide a consistent style and rhythm in writing.<br/>

    Finding Pronoun References and Specific Information is a skill in reading and understanding <br/>text which involves identifying pronouns and finding specific information related to these pronouns.

the ability to find pronoun referents and specific information is very important in understanding the text well.<br/> When we read texts, writers often use pronouns such as "he," "she," "it," "they," and so on to refer to the subject or object previously mentioned.<br/>
    <p><a style="color: rgb(125, 0, 0);">(face-to-face meetings discuss pronouns)</a><br/>
        A pronoun is a word used in place of a noun (e.g., cat, friend) or a noun phrase (e.g., the owner of the cat, my longtime friend). <br/>
        <i>For example, in the sentence “Carlo poured a cup of coffee and sipped it slowly,” <br/>
        the pronoun it replaces something previously mentioned, a cup of coffee.The cat was hungry, so it ate its food.

    Implied detail questions are a type of questioning technique used to elicit specific information or details that are not explicitly stated in a given text or conversation.<br/>
    These questions require the respondent to infer or deduce information based on the context or clues provided.<br/>
     Implied detail questions are often used to assess a person's comprehension and analytical skills, as they require the ability to make logical connections and draw conclusions.<br/>
<i>For example, if a passage describes a character feeling sad without explicitly stating the reason for their sadness, an implied detail question could be: "Why do you think the character is feeling sad?" The question prompts the reader or listener to consider the possible causes or factors contributing to the character's emotion based on the implicit information provided.</i><br/></p>
